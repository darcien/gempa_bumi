## Why

[BMKG online portal](https://dataonline.bmkg.go.id/home) for downloading earthquakes historical data sucks, requires registering an account and filling service surveys, and is limited for the last 10 days data. It says I can contact them for more data, but I doubt I will get any responses from those official channels.
